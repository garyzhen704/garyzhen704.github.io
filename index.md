### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

  Lab 2, part 2 is a particular favorite of mine because it was the first lab that featured intermediate use of the standard function library. In this lab I was able to input nouns, verbs, etc into my program and print out unique sentences. I felt anticipated to learn further more about std functions after this part.
  
* Lab 5
  
  Lab 5, part 1 introduced arguments which meant that this program could be run on the same command line. One example would be :"./sandwich turkey rye", this would print out a sentence with those ingredients filled in from the placeholder. This is unique from the other labs because to run previous programs you had to type "./a.out" first.

* Lab 8

  Lab 8, part 1 was the program that I had the most fun writing because it required extensive knowledge of the "for" statements. The objective of this part was to print out symbols and to follow a pattern of removing and adding symbols up to the constant max of 22 symbols per line. I also found the output of the program to be very cool because it taught me how to "draw" with code.
